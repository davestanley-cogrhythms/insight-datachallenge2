# insight-datachallenge2
Second data challenge for Insight

To set up:
1. Follow instructions in `setup_sql.txt` to set up your postgres SQL
1. Run `setup_yammer_db.py` to import the CSV files first into a Pandas dataframe, and then into postgres
1. Run code in `David_Stanley_Data_Challenge_2.ipynb` to start running queries on the database

This just covers setting up postgres in Python, which I ended up not using. My full analysis is online at https://modeanalytics.com/davestan/reports/9bfb9e5eeb20
